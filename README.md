# WordleSolver
This a simple tool to solve the infamous Wordle puzzles. I used string manipulation and some other common techniques for python lists and tuples to make this possible. Have fun!
# Instructions to Use
When you run this program on your local device, the command shell will prompt you for the words you have guessed and the results you've got. The program then suggests you with the word that could possibly be the answer or could help you to reach the answer in the fastest way possible. Note: You can also choose a different word other than what the program suggests you.
